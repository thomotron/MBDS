A singleplayer web-based take on the popular game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.  
Made as my Year 12 high school IT project. Check it out [here](https://bomb.tem.party).

## Defusal Instructions
If you're new to MBDS I would recommend starting out on an easier difficulty. As the difficulty ramps up, you get less time to defuse which makes it rather hard to read the manual.  
1. Enter your details and start a game
2. Drag out the manual on the left side of the screen
3. Scroll to the section that describes the module you are defusing
4. Read and follow the instructions
5. Repeat for each module
6. ???
7. Profit
